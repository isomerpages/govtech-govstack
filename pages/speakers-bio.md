### **Eyung Lim, Director, Government Digital Services, GovTech**
As the Director of Government Digital Services in GovTech, Eyung has been instrumental in shaping the digital service delivery landscape in Singapore.

He envisioned and spearheaded the Digital Experience Design (DXD) Sandbox, to aid government agencies to adopt data-driven and design-based approaches in their digital endeavours. Since its inception in October 2015, the DXD has been successfully deployed in key government projects such as the IRAS MyTax Portal, HDB Resale Portal, MSO OneService, Moments of Life and many more.

Eyung is also a key driver of whole-of-government (WOG) projects and programmes that radically changed the way the Government engages and interacts with citizens. Efforts include the implementation of the WOG Application Analytics platform (which is part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack as well as the Service Journey approach) which fundamentally streamlines offerings across government agencies around citizen needs and life stages.

As a data researcher by training, he strongly advocates the use of data in guiding better design and engineering excellence. Two such initiatives are the A/B Testing on the citizen engagement during the National Day Rally, and the time optimisation for the end-to-end continuous integration and development in the agile development process. Eyung and his team also proposed and implemented Experience-to-Emotion mapping to better understand how user experience drives behaviour.

Eyung is also a firm believer and practitioner of the “golden triangle” of product strategies, design, and engineering excellence as the critical success factors in any product implementation.<br>
